* Locate SURiX devices on your network, even if they are in a different network segment than the one you are currently connected to.
* Obtain technical details about your already installed products (such as product type, software version, device type, IP address, MAC address, etc.).
* Set an individual IP address, subnet mask, and gateway for each discovered device.

### How do I use IP Search?
IP Search requires no installation; the program comes complete with everything needed to run properly. Simply download it, and you'll be ready to go.
**Warning:** To ensure proper functionality, run 'IP Search.exe' within the original product folder.
